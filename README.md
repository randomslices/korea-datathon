# Korea-datathon-2018

Welcome to [the korea datathon workshop](http://datathon.konect.or.kr/)!

We have prepared tutorials to get you started on [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), the tool to filter, join, aggregate and extract data from the raw datasets for analysis. In the tutorial, a couple of comprehensive examples are included to show how to view the datasets, run transformations and analyze them.

please start from the [Python colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/Youngseok0001/korea-datathon-2018/blob/master/mimiciii_tutorial.ipynb) (a copy is available in the [tutorials](https://github.com/Youngseok0001/korea-datathon-2018/blob/master/mimiciii_tutorial.ipynb) folder as well), which is a Jupyter notebook hosted in Google Drive, and can be shared with other people for collaboration. It has the most comprehensive examples, including how to train machine learning models on the MIMIC demo dataset with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
